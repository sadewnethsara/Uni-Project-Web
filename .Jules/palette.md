## 2024-10-07 - Accessible Icon-Only Password Toggles
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons used for password visibility toggles (eye icons) need `aria-label` and `title` attributes that dynamically change based on state (e.g., "Show password" vs "Hide password"). Without these, screen readers announce them as generic buttons, creating a confusing experience for visually impaired users.
**Action:** Always add dynamic `aria-label` and `title` attributes to icon-only buttons that toggle state, especially in forms.
